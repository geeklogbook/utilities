## Utilities

The main goal of this repository is to save helpful code: practices, scripts, demos, or data used in forums, stack overflow, or even a blog. 

There is a lot of work in progress, scripting, and testing about data structure.

Also, you can find some implementations of the classic algorithms in some of the most well-known languages in the world and others not as known as the first.
